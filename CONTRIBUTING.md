# Contributing

From opening a bug report to creating a pull request: every contribution is
appreciated and welcome. If you're planning to implement a new feature or change
the api please create an issue first. This way we can ensure that your precious
work is not in vain.

## Issues

Most of the time, if `filter-inputs-url` is not working correctly for you, it is a simple configuration issue.

**If you have discovered a bug or have a feature suggestion,
please [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Kassaila/filter-inputs-url/issues/new).**

## Setup

[Setup your local webpack repository](_SETUP.md)

## Submitting Changes

After getting some feedback, push to your fork and submit a pull request. We
may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives, but for small changes
your pull request should be accepted quickly.

## Join the development

- Before you join development, please [set up the project](./_SETUP.md) on your local machine, run it and go through the application completely.
Use any command you can find and see what it does. Explore.

- If you would like to work on an issue, drop in a comment at the issue.
If it is already assigned to someone, but there is no sign of any work being done,
please feel free to drop in a comment so that the issue can be assigned to you if the previous assignee has dropped it entirely.
